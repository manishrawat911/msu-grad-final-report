This report compares two different approaches to develop multi-client real-time synchronized web applications. The two approaches are described in enough detail for a nonexpert to appreciate the differences, but learning to use either approach is beyond the scope of this report. The focus is to report on the developerâ€™s experience while building two demonstration applications with each approach. The functionality of the calendar and chat applications, implementations and  challenges associated with each approach are discussed. This includes a user interface comparison, lines of code, the number of required libraries and frameworks that were used to create the applications. Lastly, the report compares the size of the applications.
